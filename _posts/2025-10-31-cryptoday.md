|  10:00-10:30 || **Registrations & Welcome Coffee** |
|  10:30-10:35 || **Opening Remarks** |
|  10:35-12:05 || **Session 1** |
|  10:35-11:05 || Guillaume Endignoux (Google)  |
|              || **Post Quantum Cryptography in Tink** <details close>Tink is a multi-language, cross-platform, open source library that provides secure and easy-to-use cryptographic APIs, created and maintained by cryptographers and security engineers at Google (https://developers.google.com/tink). In this talk, we will discuss how we are approaching the transition to post-quantum cryptography in Tink. In particular, we'll see how the baked-in key rotation architecture enables smooth rotation towards other algorithms. We'll also discuss where new challenges arise and how we're tackling them. For example, how to model the concept of a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), and how to best expose it as an API that follows our easy-to-use & hard-to-misuse philosophy.</details> |
