<h1>Venue & Logistics</h1>
<h3>Lugano, Switzerland</h3>


<p>
<a href="http://www.luganoturismo.ch/en/discover/city">Lugano</a>, the largest town in the holiday region of Ticino, is not only Switzerland's third most important financial centre and a conference, banking and business centre, but also a town of parks and flowers, villas and sacred buildings. With Mediterranean flair, Lugano offers all the advantages of a world-class city, combined with the cachet of a small town.
</p>

<p>
Lugano lies in a bay on the northern side of <a href="http://www.luganoturismo.ch/en">Lake Lugano</a>, surrounded by numerous mountains offering splendid viewpoints. The traffic-free historic town centre, the numerous buildings in Italianate Lombardy style, the exclusive museums, the mountains, lake and a packed calendar of events all invite visitors to see the sights, soak up the atmosphere - and enjoy &quot;dolce far niente&quot;. Thanks to its <a href="https://meteo.search.ch/lugano">mild climate</a>, Lugano is a popular tourist destination from spring to fall.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.luganoturismo.ch/en/discover/city">town centre</a> with its Mediterranean-style squares and arcades, and numerous parks with sub-tropical plants such as the Parco Civico on the shores of the lake invite you to laze around, enjoying the atmosphere. By the lakeside promenade are the Belvedere Gardens, where the parkland boasts not only camellias and magnolias but also countless sub-tropical plants and modern works of art. <small>(Text and images courtesy of <a href="http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/lugano.html">Swiss Tourism</a>)</small>

<h3>Travel & Access</h3>
<div class="col-xs-6 main-body">
<p>Lugano is best reachable by train or by air. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By Air:</strong>
<!--<img align=right width="40%" src="./img/ch-by-plane.jpg" class="margined"/> -->
Zurich airport is approx. 200 km away from Lugano, but very conveniently connected with it by frequent trains. It takes around 2.5 hours to reach Lugano from Zurich airport. Zurich airport is serving all major worldwide destinations. The train ticket to Lugano can be purchased shortly before the trip (no need to pre-book).<br>
<br>
Lugano is reasonably well connected to Milano (about 60km distance). Milano has three airports: Malpensa (Terminal 1, Terminal 2), Linate, and Bergamo. The Malpensa Airport, which is the closest to Lugano, is connected to Lugano by train <a href="http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html">http://www.sbb.ch/</a> 
The Milano Linate and Bergamo airports are not directly connected to Lugano - passengers first need to take a shuttle bus or a train to Milano City Center and then take a train to Lugano. It will take approx. 3-4 hours from Bergamo or Linate to reach Lugano.
</li><br>
<li><strong>By Train:</strong>
<!-- <img align=right width="40%" src="./img/ch-by-train.jpg" class="margined" />  -->
Lugano train station is well connected to all major cities in Europe, e.g., Rome (via Milan), Frankfurt, or Paris (both via Zurich). Using the train is not only the most convenient but also the most environmentally friendly option to reach Lugano. Trains coming from Zurich will travel through the new <a href="http://www.gottardo2016.ch/en">Gotthard Base Tunnel</a> - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest_tunnels">world's longest and deepest travel tunnel</a>, completed in 2016 after 20 years of work. Sample travel times in hours and minutes: 1:15 from Milan, 2:08 from Zurich, 4:25 from Rome, 6:16 from Frankfurt, and 7:00 from Paris.<br><br>
Train tickets inside Switzerland have fixed prices, there is no difference between pre-booking and getting your tickets at the vending machines. Make sure you get your ticket before boarding the train: ticket sales in the train are subject to higher fees. Tickets and schedules are available at <a href="http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html">http://www.sbb.ch/</a>. If you are planning to travel a lot inside Switzerland by train, it might be worth getting a travel pass (e.g., Swiss Travel Pass or the "Half-Fare Travel card") - see <a href="https://www.swiss-pass.ch/">https://www.swiss-pass.ch/</a>. 
</li><br>
<li><strong>By Car:</strong>
<!-- <img align=right width="40%" src="./img/ch-by-car.jpg" class="margined" /> -->
We strongly advise against traveling to Lugano by car. If you are coming from Zurich, the Gotthard road tunnel is often a major bottleneck, with traffic jams of several hours each weekend. From Milan, the border at Como-Chiasso will often result in long waiting lines. Plus: once in Lugano, finding parking is difficult and expensive. You do not need a car in Lugano: the symposium venue (i.e., the University) is a 10-minute walk from the city center and most hotels. An efficient and frequent bus service connects all parts of the city (especially all recommended hotels and the University). Trains are connecting Lugano with surrounding cities, villages and attractions. However, if you want a rental car, both the airport and the train station feature a number of rental agencies.
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conference Venue</h3>
<p>
<!-- <img align=right src="./img/usi-entrance.jpg" /> -->
<!--<img align=right width="30%" src="./img/usi-campus-green.jpg" class="margined" /> -->
The Spring Crypto Day 2025 will take place in the Aula Polivalente, East Campus of the <a href="http://www.usi.ch">&quot;Universit&#224; della Svizzera italiana&quot;</a> - or USI for short. The East Campus of USI is located in Lugano (Switzerland), in Via la Santa 1, Viganello neighborhood. USI is Switzerland’s most international university, and one of the 12 certified public universities in Switzerland coordinated by <a href="https://www.swissuniversities.ch/en">swissuniversities</a>. </p>
<p>
Established in 1996, USI has grown steadily and includes today five Faculties: Architecture, Economics, Communication Sciences, <a href="http://www.inf.usi.ch/">Informatics</a> and Biomedical Sciences. USI currently counts also three affiliated entities, the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB, Bellinzona), the Institute for Oncology Research (IOR, Bellinzona) and the Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence (IDSIA, Manno).</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.inf.usi.ch">Faculty of Informatics</a> stands out as a centre of competence in advanced informatics. Since its inception in 2004, it has become one of Switzerland’s major poles for informatics teaching and research, ranking third after the two Federal Institutes of Technology, ETH Zurich and EPFL in Lausanne. It features a faculty of ~30 professors, 40+ postdocs and more than 100 PhD students.</p>

##### Program



|:-------------||-------------|
|  10:00-10:25 || **Registrations & Arrivals** |
|  10:25-10:30 || **Opening Remarks** |
|  10:30-11:00 || **Welcome Drinks** |
|  11:00-12:30 || **Session 1** |
|  11:00-11:30 || Guillaume Endignoux (Google) |
|              || **Post Quantum Cryptography in Tink** <details close>Tink is a multi-language, cross-platform, open source library that provides secure and easy-to-use cryptographic APIs, created and maintained by cryptographers and security engineers at Google (https://developers.google.com/tink). In this talk, we will discuss how we are approaching the transition to post-quantum cryptography in Tink. In particular, we'll see how the baked-in key rotation architecture enables smooth rotation towards other algorithms. We'll also discuss where new challenges arise and how we're tackling them. For example, how to model the concept of a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM), and how to best expose it as an API that follows our easy-to-use & hard-to-misuse philosophy.</details> |
| 11:30-12:00  || Lenka Marekova  (ETH Zurich) |
|              || **Analysis of the Telegram Key Exchange** <details close>We describe, formally model, and prove the security of Telegram's key exchange protocols for client-server communications. Our security proofs reduce the security of the protocols to that of their cryptographic building blocks, but the subsequent analysis of those building blocks requires the introduction of a number of novel security assumptions, reflecting many design decisions made by Telegram that are suboptimal from the perspective of formal analysis. In this talk, I'll discuss the difficulties we encountered on the way as well as the broader lessons about protocol design that can be taken from our work. This talk is based on joint work with Martin R. Albrecht, Kenny Paterson, Eyal Ronen, and Igors Stepanovs.</details> |
| 11:30-12:00  || Subhadeep Banik  (USI Lugano) |
|              || **The TEA-3 Encryption Algorithm** <details close>We present a number of observations on TEA-3, a stream cipher used in TETRA radio networks that was kept secret until recently. While the same also holds for the six other TETRA encryption algorithms, we pick TEA-3 to start with, as (i) it is not obviously weakened as TEA-1,4,7 but (ii) in contrast to TEA-2 it is approved for extra-European emergency service, and (iii) as already noted by Meijer et al at USENIX23 the TEA-3 design surprisingly contains a non-bijective S-box. Most importantly, we show that the 80-bit non-linear feedback shift register operating on the key decomposes into a cascade of two 40-bit registers. Although this hints at an intentional weakness at first glance, we are not able to lift our results to a practical attack. Also we shed some light as to why the length of the initial vector used in the cipher is limited to 29 bits. </details> |
| 12:30-14:00  || **Lunch Break** |
| 10:45-11:15  || [Anna-Lena Horlemann (University of St. Gallen)](http://user.math.uzh.ch/trautmann/Home.html) |
|              || **Code-based cryptography in different metrics** <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UcjEAZfI0poaz-zEHf_QlbAm6GOLDnkr/view?usp=sharing" style="text-decoration: underline;">slides</a> <details close>Classically code-based cryptography uses the Hamming metric, however, one can replace it by any other coding metric and the respective isometries, as long as the metric is defined on a vector space (as the ambient space). The most studied alternative metric in code-based cryptography is the rank metric, for which many results are known. Furthermore, the Lee and the sum-rank metric have recently gotten a lot of attention in this context. We will give an overview of known results and open questions for those metrics, including: 1. public key cryptosystems, 2. identification schemes and digital signatures, 3. generic decoding, 4. structural attacks on public keys. Finally, we will show how the metrics are related to each other (or other metrics) and which metric bears similarities with lattice-based cryptography.</details>|
| 11:15-11:45  || [Abhinaba Mazumder](https://www.math.uzh.ch/en/people?semId=46&key1=35576&L=1) and [Michael Schaller](https://www.math.uzh.ch/en/people?key1=36001) (UZH) |
|              || **Information Set Decoding for Convolutional Codes** <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Sn9h0zTMq3aB2M4TZhivgyM3XnLj9HFW/view?usp=sharing" style="text-decoration: underline;">slides</a> <details close>We present generic decoding algorithms for McEliece type systems that use (non-tail-biting) convolutional codes and show how to use them to reduce the security of two proposed cryptosystems. We were able to successfully recover many of the errors used in the encryption in less than 10 hours.</details>|
| 11:45-12:15  || [Luca De Feo (IBM)](https://defeo.lu/) |
|              || **The Isogeny Toolbox** <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E7G8wXRHsMONzZXUXobHS9fhnzK7xbpS/view?usp=sharing" style="text-decoration: underline;">slides</a>  <details close>They say it's hard compute an isogeny between any two elliptic curves, and yet they spend their time computing them. Isogeny people have played us for absolute fools! What does "compute" even mean for an isogeny, anyway? If you think you know, think twice. I, for one, change definition every other day. The truth is that as we kept discovering more and more algorithms / protocols / attacks, our understanding of what it means to compute an isogeny has changed, and some protocols we believed were secure were lost in the process, while others were created. In this talk I will explain how our understanding of isogeny computations has changed over time and what it means for cryptography.</details>|
| 12:15-13:15  || Lunch and Mentoring Session |
| 13:15-13:45  || [Anwar Hithnawi (ETH Zürich)](https://pps-lab.com/people/anwarhithnawi/) |
|              || **Democratizing Privacy-Preserving Computation** <details close>The potential of data to transform science and society has spurred unparalleled efforts to collect it in increasingly sensitive and granular forms, which has raised a variety of societal concerns about how this data is handled and used. Though today, at-rest and in-transit encryption are standard practices, these alone are insufficient to address the security and privacy needs of emerging complex data-driven applications in inherently privacy-sensitive domains. Moreover, these applications frequently require sharing and disclosing data for legitimate reasons. Nonetheless, prevailing data-sharing practices in these systems often disregard privacy considerations, leading to numerous instances of data misuse and abuse. In the past few decades, cryptographers have developed an array of theoretical techniques that, in principle, could address the security and privacy needs of these applications, including secure computation and privacy-enhancing techniques. The increasing urgency in addressing security and privacy concerns within these complex environments has generated a growing demand to transition these theoretical techniques into practice. While these techniques promise to enhance privacy and security for sensitive data, realizing their full potential in practice remains challenging. In this talk, I will discuss and motivate research on making privacy-preserving technologies more accessible and easier to develop and deploy. Throughout the talk, I will discuss the prevalent challenges of efficiency, functionality, and accessibility in this research area.</details>|
| 13:45-14:15  || [Florian Tramer (ETH Zürich)](https://www.floriantramer.com/) |
|              || **Stealing a Generative AI's Secrets (responsibly)** <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1On-4k4QWhFgAysBxWWA4iRbbZ5DELZL1/view?usp=sharing" style="text-decoration: underline;">slides</a> <details close>Companies that develop generative AI tools such as ChatGPT keep most development and deployment details secret. We typically don't know what the underlying model looks like (or how big it is), what it was trained on, or what safety measures are applied. In this talk, I'll show how we reverse-engineered such secrets from various production systems, and draw some connections to cryptographic problems. I'll conclude with a discussion of responsible disclosure practices in today's AI world, and how we might improve them.</details> |

| 14:35-15:05  || [Francesco Regazzoni (University of Amsterdam and Università della Svizzera italiana)](https://search.usi.ch/it/persone/3e64549cfe3f90540fbd2cb7a38a48bc/regazzoni-francesco)|
|              || **Processor Customization for Side Channel Resistance** <details close></details> |
| 15:05-15:35  || [Tommaso Gagliardoni (Kudelski security/Nagra)](https://gagliardoni.net/) 
|              || **2024 Update on Shufflecake: Plausible Deniability Is Even Sweeter** <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vbgFKRwb7dfd1XCdhW0jjxbzkn_4KuRp/view?usp=sharing" style="text-decoration: underline;">slides</a> <details close>Shufflecake is an open-source data encryption tool that allows creation of hidden volumes on a storage device in such a way that it is very difficult, even under forensic inspection, to prove the existence of such volumes. This is useful for people whose freedom of expression is threatened by repressive authorities or dangerous criminal organizations, in particular: whistleblowers, investigative journalists, and activists for human rights in oppressive regimes. You can consider Shufflecake a "spiritual successor" of tools such as TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt, but vastly improved: it is fast, supports any filesystem of choice, and can concurrently manage multiple layers of nested decoy volumes, so to improve user experience and make deniability of the existence of these partitions really plausible. Shufflecake is the result of a multi-year research aimed at solving fundamental limitations of plausible deniability tools. It is under active development, and after the initial success (DEF CON Demo Labs, ACM CCS, and others) the community of contributors is growing, bringing new ideas and results to the table. In this talk we will present the history and limitations of other existing solutions, we will show how Shufflecake works and solves such limitations, and we will highlight recent improvements, both theoretical and practical. In particular, we will announce the release of the "Lite" version of Shufflecake, and we will present the official roadmap and plans for the release of the first Shufflecake-powered fully hidden OS.</details> |
| 15:35-15:55  || Break |
| 15:55-16:25  || [Giacomo Fenzi (EPFL)](https://gfenzi.io/) 
|              || **STIR: Reed–Solomon Proximity Testing with Fewer Queries** <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bg3FhpObKjGNaN7u_dCY9FZdVm1SLfVt/view?usp=sharing" style="text-decoration: underline;">slides</a> <details close>We present STIR (Shift To Improve Rate), an interactive oracle proof of proximity (IOPP) for Reed–Solomon codes that achieves the best known query complexity of any concretely efficient IOPP for this problem. For λ bits of security, STIR has query complexity O(log d+λ· loglog d), while FRI, a popular protocol, has query complexity O(λ·log d) (including variants of FRI based on conjectured security assumptions). STIR relies on a new technique for recursively improving the rate of the tested Reed–Solomon code. We provide an implementation of STIR compiled to a SNARK. Compared to a highly optimized implementation of FRI, STIR achieves an improvement in argument size that ranges from 1.25× to 2.46× depending on the chosen parameters, with similar prover and verifier running times. For example, in order to achieve 128 bits of security for degree 226 and rate 1/4, STIR has argument size 114 KiB, compared to 211 KiB for FRI.</details> |
| 16:25-16:55  || [Ziyi Guan (EPFL)](https://ziyiguan.github.io/) 
|              || **Security Bounds for Proof-Carrying Data from Straightline Extractors** <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oI7mi58DxGLBexjhme-jfD-O5GN6VnXP/view?usp=sharing" style="text-decoration: underline;">slides</a> <details close>Proof-carrying data (PCD) is a widely used cryptographic primitive that can be obtained by recursively-composing SNARKs or related primitives. However, these constructions do not come with security analyses that yield useful concrete security bounds. In this work we show that the PCD obtained from SNARKs with straightline knowledge soundness has essentially the same security as the underlying SNARK. In this setting, recursive composition incurs no security loss. As a notable application, our work offers an idealized model that provides useful, albeit heuristic, guidance for setting the security parameters of recursive STARKs currently used in blockchain systems. Based on https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1646.pdf, joint work with Alessandro Chiesa, Shahar Samocha, and Eylon Yogev. </details> |
