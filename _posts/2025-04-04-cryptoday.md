##### Venue and Logistics

<h3>Lugano, Switzerland</h3>


<p>
<a href="http://www.luganoturismo.ch/en/discover/city">Lugano</a>, the largest town in the holiday region of Ticino, is not only Switzerland's third most important financial centre and a conference, banking and business centre, but also a town of parks and flowers, villas and sacred buildings. With Mediterranean flair, Lugano offers all the advantages of a world-class city, combined with the cachet of a small town.
</p>

<p>
Lugano lies in a bay on the northern side of <a href="http://www.luganoturismo.ch/en">Lake Lugano</a>, surrounded by numerous mountains offering splendid viewpoints. The traffic-free historic town centre, the numerous buildings in Italianate Lombardy style, the exclusive museums, the mountains, lake and a packed calendar of events all invite visitors to see the sights, soak up the atmosphere - and enjoy &quot;dolce far niente&quot;. Thanks to its <a href="https://meteo.search.ch/lugano">mild climate</a>, Lugano is a popular tourist destination from spring to fall.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.luganoturismo.ch/en/discover/city">town centre</a> with its Mediterranean-style squares and arcades, and numerous parks with sub-tropical plants such as the Parco Civico on the shores of the lake invite you to laze around, enjoying the atmosphere. By the lakeside promenade are the Belvedere Gardens, where the parkland boasts not only camellias and magnolias but also countless sub-tropical plants and modern works of art. <small>(Text and images courtesy of <a href="http://www.myswitzerland.com/en-ch/lugano.html">Swiss Tourism</a>)</small>

<h3>Travel & Access</h3>
<div class="col-xs-6 main-body">
<p>Lugano is best reachable by train or by air. 
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>By Air:</strong>
<!--<img align=right width="40%" src="./img/ch-by-plane.jpg" class="margined"/> -->
Zurich airport is approx. 200 km away from Lugano, but very conveniently connected with it by frequent trains. It takes around 2.5 hours to reach Lugano from Zurich airport. Zurich airport is serving all major worldwide destinations. The train ticket to Lugano can be purchased shortly before the trip (no need to pre-book).<br>
<br>
Lugano is reasonably well connected to Milano (about 60km distance). Milano has three airports: Malpensa (Terminal 1, Terminal 2), Linate, and Bergamo. The Malpensa Airport, which is the closest to Lugano, is connected to Lugano by train <a href="http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html">http://www.sbb.ch/</a> 
The Milano Linate and Bergamo airports are not directly connected to Lugano - passengers first need to take a shuttle bus or a train to Milano City Center and then take a train to Lugano. It will take approx. 3-4 hours from Bergamo or Linate to reach Lugano.
</li><br>
<li><strong>By Train:</strong>
<!-- <img align=right width="40%" src="./img/ch-by-train.jpg" class="margined" />  -->
Lugano train station is well connected to all major cities in Europe, e.g., Rome (via Milan), Frankfurt, or Paris (both via Zurich). Using the train is not only the most convenient but also the most environmentally friendly option to reach Lugano. Trains coming from Zurich will travel through the new <a href="http://www.gottardo2016.ch/en">Gotthard Base Tunnel</a> - the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_longest_tunnels">world's longest and deepest travel tunnel</a>, completed in 2016 after 20 years of work. Sample travel times in hours and minutes: 1:15 from Milan, 2:08 from Zurich, 4:25 from Rome, 6:16 from Frankfurt, and 7:00 from Paris.<br><br>
Train tickets inside Switzerland have fixed prices, there is no difference between pre-booking and getting your tickets at the vending machines. Make sure you get your ticket before boarding the train: ticket sales in the train are subject to higher fees. Tickets and schedules are available at <a href="http://www.sbb.ch/en/home.html">http://www.sbb.ch/</a>. If you are planning to travel a lot inside Switzerland by train, it might be worth getting a travel pass (e.g., Swiss Travel Pass or the "Half-Fare Travel card") - see <a href="https://www.swiss-pass.ch/">https://www.swiss-pass.ch/</a>. 
</li><br>
<li><strong>By Car:</strong>
<!-- <img align=right width="40%" src="./img/ch-by-car.jpg" class="margined" /> -->
We strongly advise against traveling to Lugano by car. If you are coming from Zurich, the Gotthard road tunnel is often a major bottleneck, with traffic jams of several hours each weekend. From Milan, the border at Como-Chiasso will often result in long waiting lines. Plus: once in Lugano, finding parking is difficult and expensive. You do not need a car in Lugano: the symposium venue (i.e., the University) is a 10-minute walk from the city center and most hotels. An efficient and frequent bus service connects all parts of the city (especially all recommended hotels and the University). Trains are connecting Lugano with surrounding cities, villages and attractions. However, if you want a rental car, both the airport and the train station feature a number of rental agencies.
