The Swiss Crypto Day is an informal event to promote research in cryptology
in Switzerland.  It will take place at irregular intervals.

The first edition took place in September 2019 and was hosted by the
crypto group at the [University of Bern](//crypto.unibe.ch).

There is a mailing list for announcements about the Swiss Crypto Day.
